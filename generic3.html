							<h1 class="major">Big Data Analytics</h1>
							
							<p>Big data Analytics class enabled me to strengthen my knowledge in the field of Machine Learning. The course began with all the important mathematical concepts of probability and matrices. These concepts play a crucial role in building ML models and the crash course was extremely helpful to grasp the idea behind ML codes. The course involved strong mathematical derivations that became easier to comprehend after practising a couple of examples. </p>
							<p>This course covered several important topics like K-nearest neighbours(KNN), Support Vector machines (SVM), Regression and neural networks. The coding assignments to implement these algorithms were very useful to understand these concepts in depth. </p>
							<p>The k-nearest neighbours algorithm, also known as KNN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. <br> Figure [8] below is an example of a KNN algorithm.</p>

							<p>Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. <br>Figure [9] below highlights the principle behind SVMs. </p>

							<p>Neural networks are biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enable a computer to learn from observational data. <br> Figure [10] shows a simple neural network. </p>

							<p>MNIST is a large database of handwritten digits that is largely used to train image processing systems. The usage of the MNIST dataset for all our assignments was very helpful in comprehending pixels as input to the models. <br>Figure [11] shows a sample from the MNIST dataset. </p>

							<p>In addition to coding assignments, we had a mid-term and a final project that strongly tested our understanding of the subject. For our final project, we had a reinforcement learning-based task which was quite interesting. The AWS Deep Racer competition was where we had to come up with an efficient model to complete the track in record seconds. We trained our models for over 80 hours trying different parameters so that the car could learn its track more efficiently and perform well irrespective of the design of the track. While this project was a fun and educating one, writing the code was challenging and involved many hours of brainstorming. Eventually, our team had a great presentation of the project.</p>

							<p>Overall, the coursework, although quite interesting, was time-consuming because of the coding assignments that got tricky while trying to obtain the right output. </p>
