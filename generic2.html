							<h1 class="major">Principles Of Networking</h1>
							
							<p>EE 534 course was quite an interesting subject for me and it felt like an important continuation of my undergraduate course on computer communication networks. The concept of layered network architecture as a framework was taught in depth during the class sessions. The lecture also emphasised the principal functions and services required for reliable end-to-end communications.  </p>

							<p>One technical concept we studied was that of server-client communication which is imperative not only for on-premise computing models but also for cloud computing. A client is a program that utilises the services of other programs. The programs providing these services are called servers. The client sends a request for an application, and a server performs that function. Server functions are often dependent on some resource management, in which a server manages access to the resource, and responds to client requests with either data or status information. Client programs typically handle user interactions and often request data after establishing a connection with a server or initiating some changes in data on behalf of a user. I believe gaining a solid understanding of server-client communication was imperative for me to understand the deployment of machine learning models to the cloud. </p>
							<p>The introduction to the TCP/IP protocol suite and socket programming were the topics that I found a particular interest in. TCP/IP Model is a protocol suite used to connect network devices to the Internet. While an OSI Model is a conceptual framework that can be used to describe the functionality of a network. </p>

							<p>The lectures also involved topics of routing protocols and their importance in packet transfer. Routing determines how packets (data sent over a network or networks) containing information, like email messages, website data, and voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls, move from one place to another on the Internet. Distance vector routing algorithm is one such routing algorithm that simplifies the routing process by assuming the cost of every link is one unit. Therefore, the efficiency of transmission can be measured by the number of links to reach the destination.</p>
							<center><img src="images/net3.png" alt="" /></center>
							<p>In link-state routing protocols, each router possesses information about the complete network topology. Then, each router independently calculates the best next hop from it for every possible destination in the network using local information of the topology. The collection of best-next-hops is tabulated in the routing table. </p>

							<p>Learning about the communication processes across the internet through this course, I believe I’ve gained a crucial amount of knowledge in the field of computer networks. I had taken this course to get an understanding of the way communication occurs in the world of the internet and feel content with everything that I have learned through this course. The future is in in cloud and the as the new cutting edge field, the principles of networking have a new importance all together. This is a very fun course to take for someone wanting to get a complete understanding of what happens behind the scenes of a “Google Search”.</p>
