							<h1 class="major">Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
							
							<p>I was introduced to Artificial Intelligence during my undergraduate studies and was completely taken by the subject matter and knew that I had to pursue it further in my master’s coursework. The Introduction to Machine Learning was the perfect course for me to foray into the field of ML. This class dealt with topics pertaining to the field of ML and covered topics in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Artificial intelligence(AI) is the latest tech trend and with ML as a subset of AI. Therefore, learning the ins and out of this field was an enriching experience. Handling large sizes of data, cleaning the data and finally building models with appropriate accuracy, was the highlight of this course. <br>Figure [1] below depicts the idea behind a training and test model. </p>

							<p>Machine Learning models are fed with training data to teach them how to make accurate predictions. Test data and validation data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.<br> Figure[2] below shows the various classes within Machine learning.</p>

							<p>The three main classifications of ML are Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning. I’ve briefly discussed these three classes below.<p>
							<p>Supervised learning comprised of topics such as regression and classification and set the foundation for ML. The challenging and exciting part of the course was building models without directly invoking the in-built functions. This was a great lesson and gave the idea of how mathematics is used to develop ML models. Introduction to various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy during the first week of the course was quite helpful in getting comfortable with coding assignments. 
								In addition, we also looked at unsupervised learning that comprises building models using unlabeled data. These algorithms discover patterns from within the data set without human intervention. Clustering, random forests and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) are the commonly known unsupervised algorithms. <br>
								Figure[3] below depicts the K-means clustering algorithm.

								The coursework concluded with reinforcement learning, which essentially trains ML models to take actions based on the environment. The agent learns through a sequence of events and takes decisions based on its learning. Autonomous driving cars are built using reinforcement learning techniques.<p>
							<p>With so many classes and subclasses, the question that arises is “Which algorithm should be used to solve a problem”. The main idea that lies behind selecting an ML algorithm is that it should satisfy the requirements of a project(use case/problem statement) providing adequate results. There's no notion of a "perfect" model. Most of the time, a less complex model is preferred. The coding assignments for each type of machine learning were quite effective in understanding the steps behind building an appropriate model.<p>
							<p>Topics such as data preprocessing and data visualization were introduced to realise the patterns in a given dataset. Data preprocessing is the important initial step in building ML models. It involves fetching data, extracting its features, handling null or empty samples, removing outliers, scaling and selecting attributes to satisfy the problem statement. This step is crucial for model building as it eliminates the chances of incorrect predictions on the test data set. Data visualization is a popular technique to understand the nature of the data set and gauge which model would work best in a given scenario. It provides a high-level statistical view of the data. The data is transformed into plots for further analysis.  I believe that this knowledge will help me make better decisions when I start working on them in a professional environment.<p>
							<p>As an AI enthusiast, this course not only enabled me to strengthen my skills in the field of Machine Learning but also motivated me to explore this field further as a profession. I’d highly recommend this course to anyone willing to foray into the world of AI.<p>
