							<h1 class="major">Probability and Stochastic Processes</h1>
							
							<p>To be well versed in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science, it is important to have a proper understanding of the principles of probability. This course laid down the foundation of probability and various random processes in nature. Probability models provide a direction towards building reliable and efficient machine learning models.</p>
							<p>The coursework involved the introduction to various distributions such as Poisson, Bernoulli, Binomial and Gaussian and was explained with detailed mathematical derivations and a few examples for each. It is imperative to know each distribution to assess what the nature and distribution of a particular set of data.	I’ve briefly each mentioned each distribution below.</p>
							<p>A distribution is called Poisson distribution if any of the following assumptions are valid:<br>
								- Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event.<br>
								- The probability of success over a short interval must equal the probability of success over a longer interval.<br>
								- The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller.</p>
							<p>A Bernoulli distribution has only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial. A random variable X which has a Bernoulli distribution takes value 1 with the probability of success, and the value 0 with the probability of failure.<br>
							A distribution where just two outcomes are possible, namely, success or failure and where the probability is equal for both success and failure for all the trials is a Binomial Distribution.<br>
							The probabilities of obtaining outcomes in a uniform distribution are equally likely and forms the basis of a uniform distribution. <br>
							Exponential distribution models the interval of time during the occurrence of an event.<br>
							A normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The picture below is a Gaussian curve.</p>

							<p>The second half of the syllabus dealt with stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. We discussed Markov processes, a type of stochastic process, in detail. A Markov process is a random process in which the future is independent of the past, given the present. Thus, Markov processes are analogues of the deterministic processes described by differential and difference equations.</p>
							<p>	All the theorems and derivations were clearly explained during the sessions. The assignments were quite challenging in my opinion, but it is the nature of the course and reading the prescribed materials helped. Anyone interested in mathematics and machine learning should definitely take this course.</p>
